Clustering

This project was made to provide a segmentation model for an insurance company in Portugal.
Working as data scientists for the company, our aim was to define the different customerâ€™s profiles
based on similar behaviours, so that afterwards we could develop a more targeted and efficient
marketing strategy.
This study is based on the ABT (Analytical Based Data), containing data regarding 10 296 customers,
from the first year they subscribed until the current year - 2016. Our final goal was to perform an
accurate cluster analysis. We started by extracting the observations. Then, we checked their quality,
to make sure they are efficient for the application in the different clustering techniques. Finally, after
cleaning and transforming the data, we worked on several segmentation models, and we came to the
conclusion that the best result was obtained with a total of 3 clusters, built using the hierarchical
clustering with 50 k-means method.
